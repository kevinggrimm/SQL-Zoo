  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
  WHERE player LIKE 'Mario%'

V. Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10

  WHERE gtime <= 10

VI. List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.

SELECT teamname, COUNT(gtime)
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON (teamid=id)

XI. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id = matchid)
  WHERE teamid = 'GER'

XIII. List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

SELECT mdate,
  team1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score1,
  team2,
    SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2,
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON (matchid = id)
  GROUP BY mdate, team1, team2
